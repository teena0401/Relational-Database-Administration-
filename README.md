# Relational-Database-Administration-

## Introduction
In this project, I will assume as a role of data adminstrator to perform data admintrastion tasks across three different databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL server, IBM DBS server) at a data analytics consulting company.

Tasks to perform across three databases: 
-  start by installing and configuring a database, managing users and performing a backup
-  move on to recovery, indexing, optimization and automation of routine tasks
-  restore a database, create an index, create a view and connect to a database from the command line.

This project is sectioned into three parts: (i) PostgreSQL server, (ii) MySQL server (iii) clouded based database.
